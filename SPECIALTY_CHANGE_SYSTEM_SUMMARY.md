# 🎓 Specialty Change Request System - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Project Overview

Successfully transformed the inscription system into a **Specialty Change Request System** for USTHB Faculty of Informatics students. The system allows students to request transfers between three specialties:

- **Intelligence Artificielle (IA)** - 123 students
- **Cybersécurité (SECU)** - 144 students  
- **Génie Logiciel (GL)** - 94 students

**Total Students Imported: 361**

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### New Tables Created:

#### 1. Students Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- matricule (Unique - Student ID)
- first_name, last_name
- current_specialty (IA/SECU/GL)
- palier, section, etat
- groupe_td, groupe_tp
- created_at, updated_at
```

#### 2. Specialty Change Requests Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- student_matricule (Foreign Key)
- current_specialty, requested_specialty
- motivation (Text)
- status (pending/approved/rejected)
- priority (normal/urgent)
- admin_notes
- processed_by, processed_at
- created_at, updated_at
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Components:
1. **Database Adapter** - Supports both PostgreSQL (Supabase) and SQLite fallback
2. **Student Import Script** - Parses CSV files and populates database
3. **Specialty Change Controller** - Handles all business logic
4. **API Routes** - RESTful endpoints for frontend communication
5. **Netlify Functions** - Serverless deployment ready

### Frontend Components:
1. **Main Landing Page** - Overview with statistics and navigation
2. **Specialty Change Form** - 3-step student request process
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Request management and statistics
4. **Responsive Design** - Bootstrap-based UI with modern styling

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Student Endpoints:
- `POST /api/students/search` - Find student by matricule

### Specialty Request Endpoints:
- `POST /api/specialty-requests` - Create new request
- `GET /api/specialty-requests` - Get all requests (admin)
- `PUT /api/specialty-requests/:id/status` - Update request status
- `GET /api/specialty-requests/statistics` - Get system statistics

## 📊 Current System Statistics

From our successful test run:
- **Total Students**: 361 across 3 specialties
- **Active Requests**: 3 pending requests created during testing
- **System Status**: ✅ Fully operational

### Student Distribution:
- **Cybersécurité**: 144 students (39.9%)
- **Intelligence Artificielle**: 123 students (34.1%)  
- **Génie Logiciel**: 94 students (26.0%)
