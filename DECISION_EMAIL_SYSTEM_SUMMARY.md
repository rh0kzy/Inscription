## 🔧 Current Issue & Solution

### Problem
Gmail authentication is failing with error: "Username and Password not accepted"

### Solution Required
You need to set up **App Password** for Gmail:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on Gmail
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Create password for "Mail" application
   - Name it "Inscription System"
   - Copy the 16-digit password

3. **Update .env file**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_PASS=your_16_digit_app_password
   ```

## 🚀 How the System Works
